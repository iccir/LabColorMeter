# LabColorMeter

macOS app to show correct L\*a\*b\* values under the mouse cursor. This is a reduction of
[Classic Color Meter](http://ricciadams.com/projects/classic-color-meter) which only handles [CIELAB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab_color_space) D50.

The bulk of screen capture and color conversion is done in `CaptureAndAverage.m`.
